## React Component Library

Currently in development. Details to come

TODO:
- Tests (UI? Unit?)
- Packaging into JS module
- Guidelines for differentiating between elements, molecules and organisms
- Adding logic via props into components - i.e. button onpress, should already work tbh
- Unit tests and tests before build, need to unit test any logic in the components (JEST)
- Set up storybook for viewing components and independent component development - https://codeburst.io/build-your-own-react-component-library-with-lerna-and-storybook-53298b186760
